- 👋 Hi, I’m @developeralain - I'm a software development student, a Registered Nurse, a published clinical researcher, and a passionate lifelong learner.

- 👀 I’m interested in Javascript, Python, C#, .NET, blockchain; I'm open to all projects that improve others' quality of life, are challenging, 
and help others in a meaningful way. I remain passionate about healthcare, medicine, and research, and so am partial to projects within those domains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL, C#, .NET
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... interesting projects, especially medical or healthcare related (shoot me an email!)
