**C#-and-Associated-Framework-Projects-(.Net, Core, ASP .Net, etc)**

- _Theater Group Content Management System using .Net ASP MVC:_ as part of my internship with Prosper IT Consulting, worked within a SCRUM team using Azure DevOps to develop a content management system for a Portland theater group. Various team members worked on various aspects of this project. 
I was tasked with developing the section of the web app that dealt with CRUD operations pertaining to rentals of the theater group's rooms and equipment. I developed both the front-end and back-end components: back-end utilized Entity Framework and C# while front-end used Bootstrap4, FontAwesome, Razor, and JavaScript.

Project Highlights:
Index Page - the centerpiece was the Index view which displayed in a neat and categorized fashion all rentals from customers. I developed logic to allow for search functionality and filtration of results based on minimum or maximum price. On the front-end, the user could click a button to switch between searching terms or minimum price and terms or maximum price.
Create Rental Page - featured a dropdown menu that allowed a user to select which form they'd like to have displayed in order to create a rental. This dynamic aspect allowed users to create rentals for rooms or equipment all on the same page and seemlessly. 

- _Car Insurance MVC Web App:_ using Visual Studio, C#, and the .Net framework, created an MVC Web Application that mimicked the user-experience of getting a car insurance quote online from an insurance company: the application requested the user to enter information about themselves, their car, and their driving history. It then employed business logic to calculate a quote for the user based on the personal data provided. The user could see their quote, but a special Admin view was created to display all quotes generated for all users inclusive of user demographics. This employed full CRUD database functionality and business logic.

- _TwentyOne Game:_ using Visual Studio, C#, and the .Net framework, created a console application that emulated the game of TwentyOne aka Blackjack as would be played in a Casino (i.e. with a dealer). This project involved multiple classes, abstract and virtual functions, enums, overloaded methods and operators, and among other aspects it included a logging functionality to automatically tracks all cards dealt in a game inclusive of a timestamp (logged to a .txt file).

**Python-Projects**

- _Django Framework Application:_ during a two week sprint using the Django Framework, created a fully functional Nutrition-themed web application that utilizes full CRUD functionality and database interaction, web scraping capability with BeautifulSoup4, and API access implementation via a user search query bar that returns filtered and formatted results on nutritional data for any item(s) searched. The front-end was created using the Bootstrap4 framework and Jquery. 

- _File Access and Transfer Application:_ using Tkinter for the GUI, created a console app that allows one to transfer files from points A to B that meet predefined criteria of having been modified within the past 24 hrs.

**JavaScript-Projects**

- _Tic Tac Toe Game:_ created a basic Tic Tac Toe game with a computer opponent algorhythm built-in.

- _Pizza Order Program:_ created a simple program to simulate ordering a pizza online. The user can select pizza size and toppings, and the program will keep track of the order total. When you place your order, a receipt describing your order and total owed is printed.

- _Calculator Interface:_ created a simple calculator with a user interface that allows for basic arhythmetic functions to be performed.

**HTML-and-CSS-Projects** 

- _bootstrap4 Design of Web Application:_ utilizing Bootstrap4 and JQuery, designed the front-end of a web application built on the Django Framework. 

- _bootstrap4_project:_ produced two dynamic and aesthetic single-page website variants, focused around a Mini Aussie breeding business, utilizing the bootstrap framework. Featured: text overlays, background images, web form, and dynamic navigation and responsive web design.

- _One-Page Website:_ produced a single-page website for a breeding business utilizing HTML and CSS, without the use of a framework.

- _Project:_ produced a different breeding business website layout using HTML and CSS. 

- _First_Website_Project:_ the first website I created, focused around the 'Witcher' world.
